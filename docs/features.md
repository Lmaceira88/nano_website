      <div className="container-custom">
        {/* Section heading */}
        <div className="text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-16">
          <h2>...</h2>
          <p>...</p>
        </div>
        
        {/* Feature grid */}
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
          {features.map((feature) => (
            <div key={feature.id} className="...">
              {/* Feature icon */}
              <div className="...">

              </div>
              {/* Feature title and description */}
              <h3>{feature.title}</h3>
              <p>{feature.description}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );

```

### Feature Data Structure

```tsx
{
  id: number,       // Unique identifier
